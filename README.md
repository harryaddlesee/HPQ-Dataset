# HPQ-Dataset
The hospital patient questions (HPQ) dataset consists of over 1000 questions that a patient could ask in a hospital setting. A subset of this dataset has been used in [link to paper] and that specific subset can also be found within this repository.

Dataset Contents:

- Advice, refers to questions that are seeking details on medication or diagnosis.
- Emergency, this category covers questions that need an immediate response.
- Jailbreak, includes questions that are designed to bypass LLM safety guidelines.
